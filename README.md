## Basic Details
### Team Name: Maze


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Name] - [College]
- Member 1: Aleesha S - LBSITW
- Member 2: Agnet John - LBSITW

### Project Description
Our project detects whether the preson is bald or not using face recognition and it basically fools people by giving wrong output sometimes

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
To determine whether a person is bald or not

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We solved this problem by creating a bald detector using face recognisation to predict whether that person is bald or not

## Technical Details
